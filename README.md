## Instructions
Once you have forked and cloned GamerScape, please do the following:

1. Open two terminals: The first will be for the back-end and the second will be for the front-end. Make sure to cd into the root directory for both, to start.
2. In your back-end terminal, input:
```bash

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py

python app.py
```
And, boom! The back-end is ready to go. Now for the front-end.

4. In your front-end terminal, input:
